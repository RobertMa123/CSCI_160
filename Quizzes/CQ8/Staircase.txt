Staircase:
for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < n - i; j++) {
                System.out.print(" ");
            }
            for (int k = 0; k < i; k++) {
                System.out.print("#");
            }
            System.out.println();
        }

Time complexity: the inner loop for int j decreases linearly with i, and the inner loop for int k increases, making it O(n^2)
Space complexity: O(1) since no auxilary variables are used, but would be O(n^2) if the final staircase pattern had to be stored.
