Coin Change

long[] ways = new long[n + 1];
    ways[0] = 1;
     for (long d : c) {
            for (int i = (int)d; i <= n; i++) {
                ways[i] += ways[i - (int)d];
            }
        }
        return ways[n];
    
Time Complexity: O(d * n) where d is the size of denominations available (e.g. c = {1,2,3}, d = |c| = 3), and n is the size of the array of coin values.
Space Complexity: O(n) because we have an array ways that takes n amount of auxilary space for the coin values.
